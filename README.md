# BaseSAFE

This repository contains the BaseSAFE Rust APIs, introduced by "BaseSAFE: Baseband SAnitized Fuzzing through Emulation".

The _example/_ directory contains two harnesses emulating parts of the firmware for MediaTekâ€™s Helio X10 (MT6795) baseband processor.
`_EMM_` demonstrates a crash inside the decoder for `ATTACH`/`ACCEPT` messages as part of the Mobility Management.
`_ERRC_` emulates various ASN.1 decoders which are being used for Radio Resource Control messages. Example inputs can be found inside the `_data/_` directories.

<br/>

## Setup

Make AFL++ and build _AFLplusplus/unicorn_mode_.
```
./build_afl.sh
```

A single emulation run can be started by navigating into e.g.
_examples/errc_ and executing the harness on the provided data:
```
cd examples/errc/
cargo run data/pcch.raw
```

The emulated code can be fuzzed with [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) in Unicorn mode:
```
cd examples/errc
cargo build --release
../../AFLplusplus/afl-fuzz -U -i connections/ -o out/ -m none -- target/release/errc_fuzz @@
```
