# Unicornafl Rust Bindings

This directory contains the Rust bindings which were developed as part of BaseSAFE.

Complete and refined bindings for all supported architectures are now available at [unicornafl](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/unicornafl).
Also, pure Unicorn bindings without AFL++ support can be found in upstream [Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/tree/next).

These bindings are based on SÃ©bastien Duquette's (@ekse) [unicorn-rs](https://github.com/unicorn-rs/unicorn-rs) bindings for Unicorn. They are no longer maintained.
